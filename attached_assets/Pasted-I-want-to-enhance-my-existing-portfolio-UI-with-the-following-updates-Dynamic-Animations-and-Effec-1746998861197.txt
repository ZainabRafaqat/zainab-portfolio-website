I want to enhance my existing portfolio UI with the following updates:

Dynamic Animations and Effects:

Add hover animations for project images and blog titles (e.g., scale, glow, or shift colors).

Implement a smooth page transition effect between the homepage, projects, and blog pages.

Introduce background animations like a soft morphing gradient or SVG animations for the homepage header section (a subtle techy wave effect, for instance).

Neon and Futuristic Accents:

For dark mode, add neon glow effects to buttons, links, and hover elements (think glowing edges for buttons or glowing text for titles).

The nav bar should have interactive hover effects (e.g., underline appearing from left to right on hover, or icons growing slightly).

Implement glowing text or highlighted text effects for key titles like "Projects" and "Contact".

Tech-Inspired Graphics:

In the Projects section, add tech icons or animated code brackets (e.g., for each project, hover over to show animated “code brackets” opening up around the project title).

Use subtle background patterns (like circuit board designs or tech textures) for the blog and contact sections.

Implement techy illustrations (such as vector-style abstract shapes or coding illustrations) that can pop up when hovering over certain sections.

Interactive Blog Section:

Introduce interactive hover effects on blog post thumbnails (e.g., shadow effects, hover zoom, or a subtle animation of the title and cover image).

Blog index page should have a smooth scrolling effect (where the user can scroll through blog posts with some animation when new posts load).

Contact Page:

Add floating input fields with smooth transitions, or input field animations (e.g., fields that change colors or glow when focused).

Consider adding tech-inspired UI elements like animated toggle switches or futuristic form buttons.

General Styling Improvements:

Keep a balanced dark/light mode toggle, with dark mode focused on neon or tech-inspired glowing elements and light mode focused on minimalism (soft background colors, clean typography, and light outlines).

Use fonts like Roboto Mono or Space Grotesk for titles and code-inspired text, and use Inter or Poppins for body text.

Ensure that animations are smooth but not too overpowering; focus on subtlety and elegance.

Typography and Icons:

Add more typographic flair for headings: Think bold titles, some uppercase titles, and maybe some slightly skewed text for visual impact in some areas.

Update the icons used in the tech stack section and footer with minimalistic line icons or neon-style icons.
